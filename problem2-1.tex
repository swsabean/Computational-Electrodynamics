2.1 Use the Taylor's series expansion method to a derive a second-order accurate 
central-difference approximation for $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$.

\textsc{Solution:} To derive a second-order accurate central-difference approximation for $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$ using Taylor's series expansion, we can begin by expanding $u(x \pm \Delta x)$ in a Taylor series around $x$:
\[
u(x + \Delta x) = u(x) + \Delta x \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x) + O(\Delta x^2),
\]
\[
u(x - \Delta x) = u(x) - \Delta x \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x) + O(\Delta x^2).
\]
Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate the even-order terms:
\[
u(x + \Delta x) - u(x - \Delta x) = 2 \Delta x \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x) + O(\Delta x^3).
\]
Solving for $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x)$, we get:
\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x) = \frac{u(x + \Delta x) - u(x - \Delta x)}{2 \Delta x} + O(\Delta x^2).
\]
This is the second-order accurate central-difference approximation for $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x)$. The error term is proportional to $\Delta x^2$, which means that the approximation becomes more accurate as $\Delta x$ gets smaller. However, this approximation is not as accurate as the third- or fourth-order approximations.
